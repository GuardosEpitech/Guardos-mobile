const teamDescription = `Our journey began during our time as students, 
brought together by a shared passion for making a positive impact. 
What unites us is not only our academic pursuits but a common understanding 
of the challenges posed by food intolerances. 
Whether personally affected or witnessing the struggles of friends and family, we recognized the need for change.
Driven by empathy and a desire to contribute, we formed a team committed to making a difference in the lives of 
those dealing with food intolerances. 
Our diverse backgrounds and skills converge with a singular purpose â€” to create solutions that enhance the quality of life 
for individuals affected by dietary restrictions. 
Together, we embark on a journey to empower and support our community, one innovative idea at a time.`;
