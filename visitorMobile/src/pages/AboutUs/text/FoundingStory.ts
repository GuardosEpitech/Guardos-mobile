const foundingStory = `Our journey at Guardos commenced during our college days, 
where a diverse group of individuals, each navigating the challenges of food intolerances, found common ground. 
Whether grappling with our own dietary restrictions or witnessing the struggles of friends and family, 
we recognized the pervasive inconvenience of deciphering suitable meals. 
Fueled by the collective desire to simplify the process of finding delicious and tailored dining options, 
we came together with a shared mission: to solve the intricate puzzle of eating well, no matter the dietary constraints. 
Thus, Guardos was born, a dedicated effort to empower individuals in their quest for enjoyable and hassle-free dining experiences.`;
